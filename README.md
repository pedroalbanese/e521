Edwards Curve E-521 

#### ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ITI DOC-ICP-01.01 â€” Brazilian Cryptographic Standards for Public-Key Algorithms  
Brazil's national public key cryptographic standards are defined in the **DOC-ICP-01.01**, issued by the **Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia da InformaÃ§Ã£o (ITI)** under the **ICP-Brasil** framework. This standard mandates the use of internationally recognized and security-reviewed asymmetric algorithms, including:

- **ECC over Curve E-521**, defined as a high-security elliptic curve consistent with 512-bit security strength, considered for future-safe digital signatures and key agreement mechanisms.

These algorithm is officially approved through the **InstruÃ§Ã£o Normativa ITI nÂº 22, de 23 de marÃ§o de 2022**, which consolidates and updates the cryptographic requirements under Brazilian law, ensuring strong digital security for certificates and signatures in national electronic documents and transactions.
